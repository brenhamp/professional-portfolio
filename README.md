# Professional Portfolio

I have created a webpage that will showcase current and future coding projects.

## Features

* A navigation bar that provides links to areas of the page.
* A welcome jumbotron with a profile picture.
* An "about me" section.
* A "skills and experience" section where I can provide education and work background information.
* A "projects" section containing clickable images that direct users to my live projects.
* A "contact" section with relevant contact information.
* CSS stylings and media queries.

## Live Site Link

I admit it looks more like an old GeoCities page than a professional website right now, and I couldn't quite get the media queries to all function correctly, but it's still a work in progress. I will be coming back to update it and make it part of my resume.

Any feedback would be appreciated.
Thank you for reading!
